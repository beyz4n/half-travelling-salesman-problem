# half-travelling-salesman-problem
This code can be run giving the input file name directly and if you give an invalid input file name then you will get the python's error for file not found.
You need to have python libraries:
-> matplotlib
-> numpy
-> scikit learn
-> networkx
You can get them using pip install function name.

(Note: For the duplicate cities, we only considered the inputs given. So if you give a different input with duplicate cities, it may not work properly for the "verifier" since it will have duplicates.)
